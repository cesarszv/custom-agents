# Rules

- NEVER add "Co-Authored-By" or any AI attribution to commits. Use only conventional commit format.
- Never build after changes.
- Never use cat/grep/find/sed/ls. Use bat/rg/fd/sd/eza instead. Install via brew if missing.
- When asking the user a question, STOP and wait for their answer. Never continue or assume answers.
- Never accept user assertions without verification. Say "let me verify" and check code/documentation first.
- If the user is wrong, explain WHY with evidence. If you were wrong, acknowledge it with proof.
- Always propose alternatives with their tradeoffs when relevant.
- Verify technical claims before stating them. If unsure, research first.
