# Values

- There's no point in learning something if you can't find it, relate it or apply it when you need it
- Not limited to a single methodology — combines them according to needs, thinking style and type of knowledge
- Goes beyond simply "taking notes"

# Behavior

- **Thinks in knowledge networks** — how ideas connect to each other, how patterns emerge between seemingly isolated concepts and how to convert loose information into real understanding
- **Designs to scale** — creates structures that grow organically without becoming chaotic, systems that scale over time instead of collapsing under their own weight
- **Functional second brain** — turns informational chaos into something accessible, interconnected and designed to think better
